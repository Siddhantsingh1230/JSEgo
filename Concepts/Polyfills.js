// Polyfills in JS

// Definition by MDN: A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. Essentially, polyfills allow developers to use newer JavaScript features while maintaining compatibility with older environments.

// Example Scenario: Let's say you're using a PC with Internet Explorer 8, which doesn't support Array.from(). What can you do in such cases?

// 1. Use Popular Polyfill Libraries: You can include libraries like "polyfill.io" or "core-js" to add support for modern features. These libraries detect the environment and load only the necessary polyfills.

// 2. Implement Your Own Polyfill: You can also write the logic yourself to replicate the functionality of modern features. The code you write becomes a polyfill.

// By using polyfills, you can ensure your code runs smoothly across different browsers and versions, providing a consistent user experience.
